I am Elom, a PhD Candidate in computational neuroscience at Columbia University working in the labs of Dr. Larry Abbott and Dr. Mark Churchland. My research spans a variety of topics, ranging from nonlinear optimization; dynamical systems theory; motor control; learning and memory; to sensory representations. In essence, anything related to using computational approaches to understand the principles underlying brain organization and neural activity in general. I am particularly interested in understanding the principles underlying our ability to continuously learn a vast amount of skills throughout our lives.
