# Elom A. Amematsro
**Kempner Research Fellow, Kempner Institute, Harvard University**

I study how intelligent systems—brains and robots—learn flexible, hierarchical control. My work bridges **reinforcement learning and statistical inference** with **computational motor neuroscience** and **robotics**, aiming for theory that both explains neural computation and scales to embodied agents.
